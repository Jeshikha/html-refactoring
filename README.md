# <HTML-REFACTORING-FOR-HORISEON>

## Description

This week my work is an on-the-job ticket for a marketing agency to refactor one of their existing site to make it more accessible and to meet a certain set of standards or for them to implement a new technology..
I have adjusted the header and navigation, changed the title, classified appropriate sections, given class IDs, simplified the footer and added alt to the images on its HTML file. I have also changed the CSS page accordingly, given that class IDs simplified the style and made it shorter and efficient for same formats. I have created a repository in Git Hub to follow up with my commits and pushing changes each and everytime.


## Installation
VS code was used to implement changes on HTML and CSS files.
Git Hub was used to create a repository so that my team mates could follow the changed made throughout this project and also to publish my website online.
